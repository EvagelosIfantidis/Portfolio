# Advanced Machine Learning: Projects

## Project 1: Advanced Machine Learning  
**Title:** Are Regression Trees More Than Intuitive Visualizers?  
**Authors:** Felix Hult & Evagelos Ifantidis  

### Overview  
This project explores the predictive capabilities of regression trees compared to more advanced ensemble methods such as Gradient Boosting and Random Forests.   

### Objective  
The main goal is to investigate whether regression trees can serve as effective predictive models in regression tasks — beyond their value as intuitive visual tools.  

### Methodology  
To address this question, we:  
- Implement and compare **Regression Trees**, **Random Forests**, and **Gradient Boosting** models.  
- Apply the models to a **housing price prediction** problem.  
- Evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics to assess predictive power and interpretability trade-offs.  

## Project 2: Advanced Machine Learning  
**Title:** PCA & Autoencoders for Enhancing Logistic Regression and SVM  
**Authors:** Felix Hult & Evagelos Ifantidis  

### Overview  
This project investigates how dimensionality reduction techniques — both linear and nonlinear — can enhance the performance of traditional classification models such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM).  

### Objective  
The main goal is to evaluate whether **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Autoencoders** can improve predictive accuracy and computational efficiency when applied to high-dimensional data.  

### Methodology  
We use a real-world dataset for the **classification of breast cancer diagnoses**, where features are extracted from digitized images.  
Steps include:  
- Applying **PCA** (linear reduction) and **Autoencoders** (nonlinear reduction) to preprocess the data.  
- Training **Logistic Regression** and **SVM** models on the transformed feature sets.  
- Comparing model performance before and after dimensionality reduction to assess improvements in accuracy and efficiency.
