## Master's Thesis: Energy Output Forecasting using Machine Learning

This folder contains the code and analysis for my master's thesis, focusing on forecasting energy production using hybrid machine learning models (LightGBM and LSTM).

### Notebook Overview

- **EDA.ipynb**  
  Exploratory data analaysis of the energy and temperature datasets. 

- **Models.ipynb**  
  Code for the forecasting models used in this paper (LightGBM, LSTM, Naive Model).

- **MODELS_COLAB.ipynb**  
  Notebook for the LSTM model, optimized for faster execution. Requires a powerful GPU.

- **RESULTS.ipynb**  
  Plots of the results. 

### Models Overview
Contains the trained LightGBM models. Models are saved to shorten runtime.
