## Deep Learning Project: Sports Image Classification  

### Dataset  
The dataset consists of **8,000 images** of sports activities sourced from Kaggle. Seven sports are included. The images vary greatly in composition: some are from professional events, some are advertisements, and others appear to be from non-professional contexts.  

### Objective  
The goal of this project is to **correctly classify each image according to its corresponding sport**. Additionally, the project explores:  
- Different CNN architectures  
- The impact of using **color vs. grayscale** images on model performance  

### Methodology  
We implement **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to perform the classification task. Models are trained and evaluated on the dataset, comparing architecture choices and input image types.
